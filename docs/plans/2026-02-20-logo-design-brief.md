# Briefflow — Logo Design Brief

*Prepared for Nano Banana — February 2026*

## 1. About the Product

**Briefflow** is a personal newsletter triage and reading tool. It connects to Gmail, lets the user sort newsletters (keep or skip), then generates AI-summarized editions displayed as a newspaper-style gazette.

**Core value proposition:** "Your daily newsletter companion. Zero effort."

It's a single-user tool — a private editorial assistant, not a social product or productivity app.

## 2. Product Personality

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tone** | Calm, confident, understated |
| **Register** | Editorial, slightly literary — not techy |
| **Metaphor** | A personal daily gazette / morning briefing |
| **Mood** | The quiet authority of a well-edited newspaper |
| **What it is NOT** | Loud, playful, corporate, social-media-like |

The product uses vocabulary like "gazette," "Today's Pick," "In Brief," "That's it for today." — the language of a composed editor, not a tech startup.

## 3. Current Visual Identity

The app already has a strong aesthetic direction:

- **Palette:** Warm off-whites (aged newsprint feel), stone greys, near-black with warm brown undertone. No bright accent colors anywhere.
- **Typography:** Tight tracking, confident weight hierarchy. Section headers are uppercase with wide tracking (classic editorial).
- **Layout:** Three-tier gazette: headline card → expandable hooks → compact briefs — modeled on newspaper proportions.
- **Motion:** Subtle, purposeful. Fade-ins and spring-physics slide panels. Nothing bouncy or attention-seeking.

**Color tokens (for reference):**

| Role | Value | Feel |
|------|-------|------|
| Background | `oklch(0.985 0.004 80)` | Warm off-white / newsprint |
| Foreground | `oklch(0.16 0.01 50)` | Dark warm brown |
| Muted | `oklch(0.965 0.004 80)` | Faint warm cream |
| Border | `oklch(0.935 0.005 80)` | Subtle warm rule |

The hue angle of 80 (yellowish-brown) unifies the entire light theme. The palette is entirely monochromatic in the warm stone range.

## 4. What We Need

A **full logo system** with all variations:

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Combined lockup** | Logomark + wordmark together (primary usage) |
| **Logomark** | Standalone symbol, works at small sizes (favicon, app icon) |
| **Wordmark** | Custom typographic treatment of "briefflow" |
| **Favicon** | Optimized for 16×16, 32×32, and 192×192 (PWA) |

**File formats:** SVG (primary), PNG at key sizes.

## 5. Style Direction

**Editorial / typographic.** The logo should feel like it belongs on a newspaper masthead or the cover of a literary review — not a SaaS landing page.

Key principles:

- **Warm, not sterile.** The brand lives in cream and warm grey, not cold white and blue.
- **Restrained authority.** Confidence comes from simplicity and proportion, not from boldness or decoration.
- **Typographic craft.** The name "briefflow" is always lowercase, one word. Any wordmark treatment should respect this — tight, considered, slightly literary.
- **The logomark should be distinct but quiet.** It needs to work as a favicon and be recognizable at small sizes, while fitting the editorial register. Possible directions: a subtle nod to a folded newspaper, a flowing letterform, a gazette column — but this is open to interpretation.

## 6. Constraints

- **Primary usage context:** Web app header and browser favicon. Not print, not merchandise (for now).
- **Must work on warm off-white backgrounds** (the app's default) and on white/dark surfaces.
- **No bright colors.** The brand palette is monochromatic warm tones. If color is introduced, it should be a warm accent, not a departure.
- **Legibility at small sizes** is critical — the favicon and nav header are the most common placements.

## 7. What to Avoid

- Tech/startup aesthetic (gradients, glow effects, geometric abstractions)
- Playful or illustrative style (mascots, icons with faces)
- Overly literal newsletter imagery (envelope icons, inbox metaphors)
- Cold, clinical minimalism (pure black/white, no warmth)
- Complexity that breaks down at favicon sizes

## 8. Summary

Briefflow is a quiet, editorial product that treats newsletters like a curated daily gazette. The logo should match that register — warm, typographic, confident, and restrained. Think newspaper masthead meets modern digital product.
